            San Francisco: the best and the worst
        </h1>
        <h2>
        The best neighborhood is The Tenderloin
        </h2>
    <p> 
        I love filthy alley, sketchy people and unsuspecting <strong>European victims</strong>.

    <h2> The worst neighborhood is The Mission 
        </h2>
        <p> I hate pretentiou artists, local tourists and people with too much money.
